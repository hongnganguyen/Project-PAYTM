Project Overview:

The PayTM Analysis project involves managing the data of a payment application. The database consists of four main tables: payment_history_18, paying_method, product, and table_message. Below are the details of each table's components:

payment_history_18:
order_id: Unique identifier for each order
customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer
product_id: Unique identifier for each product
promotion_id: Unique identifier for the promotion (promotion_id = 0 indicates no promotion, while promotion_id â‰  0 indicates a promotion)
bank_id: Unique identifier for each bank
platform_id: Unique identifier for each payment method
app_version: Version of each application
message_id: Unique identifier for each payment notification
discount_price: Discounted amount when a promotion code is applied
final_price: Price after discount
transaction_date: Transaction date
paying_method:
method_id: Unique identifier for each payment method
name: Name of each payment method
product:
product_number: Unique identifier for each product
sub_category: Subcategory of each product
category: Product category
product_group: Product group
online_offline: Payment type
table_message:
message_id: Unique identifier for each payment notification
description: Notification for each order
Data Management of the PayTM payment app:

Customer behavior analysis: Identify the most frequently purchased products on the app.
Promotion program analysis: Provide an overview of transactions with successful discount codes. Measure the effectiveness of promotion programs.
Cohort analysis: Define the customer dataset for the best-selling product in 2018.
RFM analysis: By dividing each group for self-study, we conducted analysis and divided customers into segments.
Conclusion:

Based on the data management project of the PayTM payment app, we analyzed the most frequently purchased products on the app and could propose several promotion programs. Additionally, we measured the effectiveness of promotion programs, specifically by measuring the number of customers who returned to make a second purchase after the initial transaction with a promotion. The number of returning customers exceeded 50% of the total app users. This highlights the importance of attracting customers through promotion programs. Furthermore, cohort and RFM analysis can be conducted to identify the customer dataset for a product over 12 months. This allows us to make observations and insights about the customer segment for that product.
